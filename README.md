Recommender systems often employ personalized rankings to display listings to their users. Due to the position effect, users are more likely to interact with items shown at the top. The unbiased-learning-to-rank literature has considered several related problems arising in search engines, but less attention has been devoted to two-sided marketplaces. In these platforms, differently from search engines, listings have capacity constraints that cause rankings to change more frequently; moreover, ensuring fairness has recently become a goal of many such platforms. In this simulation study, we consider a model of an online two-sided platform where listings are ranked according to a relevance-based policy, and we analyze supply-side fairness with respect to downstream metrics, under different level of crowding, in equilibrium.
